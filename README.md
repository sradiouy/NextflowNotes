# NextflowTutorial

This is a nextflow tutorial to create a simple pipeline

## Step 1

First I wil clone these github repository to the local server: 

> git clone https://github.com/sradiouy/NextflowTutorial.git

## Step 2 

Every nextflow workflow requires two main files: 
  . main.nf
  . nextflow.config
  
The main.nf file contains the main nextflow script that calls the processes.
It doesnâ€™t have to be named main.nf but that is standard practice.

The nextflow.config file contains default parameters to use in the nextflow pipeline

> touch main.nf nextflow.config

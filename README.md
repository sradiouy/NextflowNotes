# NextflowTutorial

This is a nextflow tutorial to create a simple pipeline. Also I will add notes and thing that are useful for future use.

## Step 1

First I wil clone these github repository to the local server: 

  git clone https://github.com/sradiouy/NextflowTutorial.git

## Step 2 

Every nextflow workflow requires two main files: 
  . main.nf
  . nextflow.config
  
The main.nf file contains the main nextflow script that calls the processes.
It doesnâ€™t have to be named main.nf but that is standard practice (**highly recommended!**)

The nextflow.config file contains default parameters to use in the nextflow pipeline

```bash
  touch main.nf nextflow.config
```
## Step 3 

Modification of the main.nf to create a basic program.

Every nextflow main.nf need to have this line:
  #! /usr/bin/env nextflow

Then I will add a few lines to the main.nf to do really simple stuff:
```nextflow
  #! /usr/bin/env nextflow
  
  user="sradio"
  params.jobid ="bioinformatician"
  
  println "These is a pipeline created by $user who is a $params.jobid"
```

The output will be: 

>N E X T F L O W  ~  version 22.04.4
>
>Launching `main.nf` [trusting_sinoussi] DSL2 - revision: 3f4be19378
>
>These is a pipeline created by sradio who is a bioinformatician

Is important to note that the parameteres (user and jobid) are of two types: 

- Internal: need to be defined in the scirpt body
- External: could have a default value in the body of the script, but the value could change when the pipeline is executed using the double hyphen. As an example in these case:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf --jobid "manager"
```

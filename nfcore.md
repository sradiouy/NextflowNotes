# Pipeline schema

nf-core pipelines have a nextflow_schema.json file in their root which describes the different parameters used by the workflow. These files allow automated validation of inputs when running the pipeline, are used to generate command line help and can be used to build interfaces to launch pipelines. Pipeline schema files are built according to the JSONSchema specification (Draft 7).
